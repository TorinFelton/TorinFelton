## hi :D

I'm a software engineer working at Optiver in Amsterdam. I've been programming as a hobby for quite a while, occasionally building projects on here for fun. I've largely stopped uploading public projects unless I find them particularly interesting.

## **I have no particular allegiance to individual tech stacks/tools/languages/paradigms -- I cling to whatever I find interesting or challenging.** 

I have experience across the board, including a small amount of hardware design (verilog+FPGAs), various languages like C++/Java/Python/C/ARMv8, web development using JS frameworks, desktop application development in C#, etc.

## other hobbies???
Piano is the other half of my life, though I'm also quite interested in fashion.

### Mini OS

Wrote, from scratch, a small operating system to run on an ARM CPU. Includes I/O interactions for a physical board, and software-based multi-threading support.

### hustl.io (team)

Team project to build a competitive paper-trading based on live stock market data. I really enjoyed getting this platform up and running, and I was happy to be able to contribute both to front and back end. 

### Creating an Interpreter

I thought I'd challenge myself for my secondary-school project: Create a working interpreter that can understand basic programming concepts, e.g. flow control, expressions, I/O, etc.
I completed the code over a few weekends before the actual project was supposed to begin, just because I wanted to do it so badly and couldn't stop after I'd begun. In the end, I was extremely happy to receive a mark of 100% for it.

I've since added a few extra things outside of the coursework, such as function definitions and fully Boolean/maths/mixed expression support e.g. `2*(31 + -1) == 3 && 1 != 20 * 3`

### SpotlightX

Got annoyed with how inconsistent the Windows 10 search/launchbar was when you wanted specific apps you regularly use. Made my own. Planning to refactor codebase at some point, hoping to maybe make a proper file-indexing system.
