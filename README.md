# About Me
I'm a 1st year BSc Computer Science student at The University of Manchester. I've been programming as a hobby for a few years, building projects on here for fun. I am aiming to get into a Fintech job in the future, preferably something to do with HFT / low-latency systems, although I'm interested in the field as a whole.

That said, I still like to maintain a diverse range of projects as the real passion I have is for fast-paced learning and a continuously challenging project.

Team project to build a competitive paper-trading based on live stock market data. I really enjoyed getting this platform up and running, and I was happy to be able to contribute both to front and back end. We managed to reach ALL of our initial goals and still have time for testing at the end, along with a live production server that I setup: https://hustlio.herokuapp.com

### Creating an Interpreter

I thought I'd challenge myself for my secondary-school project: Create a working interpreter that can understand basic programming concepts, e.g. flow control, expressions, I/O, etc.
I completed the code over a few weekends before the actual project was supposed to begin, just because I wanted to do it so badly and couldn't stop after I'd begun.

I've since added a few extra things outside of the coursework, such as function definitions and fully Boolean/maths/mixed expression support e.g. `2*(31 + -1) == 3 && 1 != 20 * 3`

Got annoyed with how inconsistent the Windows 10 search/launchbar was when you wanted specific apps you regularly use. Made my own. Planning to refactor codebase at some point, hoping to maybe make a proper file-indexing system.
